<img src="images/welcome.jpg" alt="Welcome to HelloVideo" /><figcaption>Welcome to HelloVideo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Welcome to the HelloVideo Documentation. In this file you will find the requirements required to install the script, instructions on how to install the script, instructions on how to configure different parts of the script, and troubleshooting tips.</p>
<p>So, lets begin…</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>The requirements for this script are pretty minimal, but each requirements must be installed for the script to be fully functional.</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP &gt;= 5.4</li>
<li>Mcrypt PHP Extension</li>
<li>OpenSSL PHP Extension</li>
<li>Mbstring PHP Extension</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these requirements are installed on most modern hosting plans. Please see our Premium Hosting link for our recommended solution for hosting.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Installing the script is very simple. Additionally be sure to checkout our <a href="http://hellovideoapp.com/dashboard/quick-start-videos">quick start</a> videos where you will be walked through step-by-step on the installation process. Follow these basic steps to get the HelloVideo script setup and installed on your server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload all the files from the hellovideo.zip contents to the root folder of your website location. The files you upload to your root folder will look like the following: (note if you are installing the developer version there are a few more steps required, please see the quick start videos for more info)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/hellovideo-files.jpg" alt="HelloVideo Files" /><figcaption>HelloVideo Files</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>After all the files have been uploaded to your server, you’ll need to create a new database for your script.</li>
<li>Next you’ll need to add those new database credentials by opening the .env file and adding your database host, name, username, and password, the file you will edit look like the following and you’ll be replacing localhost, database, username, and password accordingly:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=database
DB_USERNAME=username
DB_PASSWORD=password</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>After adding your database credentials be sure to save the file and then visit yoursite.com and you should see the following install screen in your browser (if not all the requirements pass you may have to contact your hosting provider to make sure your server meets all the requirements):</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/hellovideo-install.jpg" alt="HelloVideo Installer" /><figcaption>HelloVideo Installer</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Finally, Click ‘Visit Your New Site’ button and you should see your new HelloVideo site in front of you:</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/hellovideo-site.jpg" alt="HelloVideo Site" /><figcaption>HelloVideo Site</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>And Just as easy as that you’ve just setup your new Video site. (!!! IMPORTANT !!!, make sure to remove the install.php file from your server, this is a security risk if you do not remove this file)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>
<p>Upgrading the script is very simple. To upgrade to the latest version of the script, simply replace the ‘application’ folder with the new ‘application’ folder and you’ll be upgraded to the latest version.</p>
<p>To upgrade in the developer version you’ll have to look at the changelog(http://hellovideoapp.com/changelog) and make the file changes from your version up to the current version.</p>
<h2 id="admin-login">Admin Login</h2>
<p>After successfully installing the script on your site you will be able to login with the default admin credentials:</p>
<p><strong>username:</strong> admin</p>
<p><strong>password:</strong> password</p>
<p>After loggin in successfully you can hover over your username on the top right, and click on ‘My Profile’:</p>

<p>To access the analtyics section you must connect with your Google Analytics account. If you do not have an account you can Go Here to signup for a Google Analytics account.
